2010 April 21. Beachballing. Inspired by the spinning beachball cursor from Mac OS X.
Tested as working in: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera 10.5+, MobileSafari.
Should also work everywhere else once those browsers support 2d transforms.
Still image taken from MarbleOfDoom.com, and Photoshopped to recreate the spiral stripes as a new layer while removing the original stripes.
